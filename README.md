#WebProjectFinal
This web project utilizes Web3 service, Solidity, JS, and HTML to create a real crypto transfer system.
With just one click, you can send crypto around the world. Simply enter the wallet address you want to use,
choose the amount, add a message, and send!

The website is connected to MetaMask Ethereum wallet, which allows for easy connection to the web and seamless crypto transfers.

This project was inspired by JavaScript Mastery.
